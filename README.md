# 🌾 CropAI Research

A research-driven project for **multimodal crop classification** using deep learning — powered by **3D CNNs with ConvLSTMs**. This project explores satellite-based crop identification through advanced spatiotemporal models and offers an interactive platform to test and visualize model performance.

## 🚀 Project Overview

CropAI Research is an academic research project developed at **UM6P College of Computing**, in collaboration with **SDAS Group** and **ENSA Berrechid**.

### 🌐 Key Features

- 📚 Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on crop classification (2022–2025)
- 🧠 Hybrid deep learning architecture using 3D CNN + ConvLSTM
- 📊 Dataset benchmarking (Sentinel, SAR, Hyperspectral)
- 🧪 Web app to test model predictions on sample imagery
- 📈 Metrics visualization: accuracy, F1, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- 📂 Downloadable reports: internship outline, dataset analysis, review draft


## 🌍 Deployment

This project is deployed on **Vercel** (Free Plan). Visit the live version:
